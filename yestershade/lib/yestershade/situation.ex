   The Darkling Sphere has long awaited one such as yourself.
   The other Fallen, holding with pale, spindly fingers to
   the pittance of life left to them, would rejoice at your
   arrival if they could drag their feeble bodies out of the
   dark corruption that even now gnaws at them, threatening to
   consume both flesh and essence.
   Will you join their stooped ranks, wallowing in the ashes, Fallen One?
   It is most inoportune that the choice does not lie entirely with you.

    You awake. Your body is sunk in a pile of ash. The walls about you are
    smooth, dark stone. Raising your head, you spy a glimmer of light far, far
    above you.
    What will you do?"
